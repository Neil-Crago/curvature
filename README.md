# Curvature 

Curvature Reconstruction and Path Length Estimation from Sparse Data. This crate simulates sparse curvature data, reconstructs it using wavelets and Lomb-Scargle periodogram, detects high-curvature hotspots, computes path length with z-bias, and incorporates Bayesian uncertainty estimation and QFT feedback for threshold adjustment.
